This is a sample Flask app with PYTHONPATH for Cloud Foundry.

PYTHONPATH is defined in .profile. More information about .profile is [here](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/deploy-app.html).

As an alternative, you can use [this](http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/settings.html#pythonpath) when using gunicorn.
